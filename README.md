# MyArtema - Blockchain version
My Artema is an art social network based on blockchain technology. It will be able to reward it's artists that utilize the app and will think through how to make an artists life better.

## Getting Started

### Requirements for the project 

To install this project you will need the following

#### Truffle

#### Ganache

#### Node

#### IPFS

### How to run the project

In order to run the project you must first of all clone the project

```
git clone ...
```

Once cloned you have to install the packages with the following :

```
npm install
npm install -g webpack webpack-cli
```

Next you have to launch ganache in order to deploy your contracts to a private ethereum network

Once installed and ganache running you have to compile the contracts end migrate them

```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

## Ideas

### Notifications window

each time there's a transaction going on, instead of holting the window, just have a status box to the bottom right with all the ongoing transactions. 

### Donations

when on the artist page, if the viewer wants to send ether, just type the amount (quantity converts into dollars when typing the amount) and send easily

### artema coin 

Instead of using ether maybe use artema coins ? rewarded also to those that just use the app

When buying you can buy in artema coins of in ether
